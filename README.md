# Your Title Here

## Project Description

Describe the purpose of the program.

### Input files

Describe the input files used by the program. (Located in "data/".)

### Output files

Describe the output files generated by the program. (To be generated in "results/".)

### Report

Templates for .tex and .odt formats are provided in "docs/". The formatting can be changed, but the sections should remain the same. The final report should be placed in "docs/" as "report.pdf".

## Running the program

### Dependencies

Describe the operating system, programs (MATLAB/Python/C), version numbers, and external packages that need to be installed to run the program. Canonically, it should run on the SIE Linux VDI, but if you require a different configuration (e.g., more updated MATLAB version) you can state it here.

### Build

Describe how the C program should be compiled (using gcc or mex). The executable or shared object file can be placed in the "bin/" directory.

### Execute

Describe how the program should be executed. Ideally, it will be automated to one line of code in a terminal running Bash (e.g., `matlab -batch src/myscript`), with the outputs generated to "results/".

## Contributors

List the authors of the code.

## Acknowledgments

### Data sources

Describe sources of data here.

### Code

Describe large code contributions not mentioned in the code itself (for small blocks of code or functions, sources can be cited in the code).

- taken from other programs
- generated by LLMs (including documentation) - specify which LLM
