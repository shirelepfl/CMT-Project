# Lung Cancer Modelisation

## Project Description

The aim of our project is to create a visual awareness compaign for smoke prevention for a young public. We created a code to compare 2 scenarios, 2 youngs but one is sportive, healthy and is in good shape and the other one smokes, has bad habits. Our C code made the calculations for cancer progression in cells using the KPP equation, also kown as Fisher equation. On the other end, our MatLab code plotted the results to model the spatial spreading of cancer cells.

### Input files

We didn't need to implement data from another file, we directly made assumptions of the initial values that were typical values for our cases.  

### Output files

The C code generates 2 CSV files containing numbers of cancer cells at each time steps, we chose each 5 days on a total of 120 days.
The MatLab code generates a gif of lungs with cells turning red when cancerous at each time step, for the healthy and smoker case. The gif generates them one after the other. It can be found in the output files on MatLab when clicking on the preview button.

### Report

Templates for .tex and .odt formats are provided in "docs/". The formatting can be changed, but the sections should remain the same. The final report should be placed in "docs/" as "report.pdf".

## Running the program

### Dependencies

On the C code, the libraries that need to be included are: stdio.h, stdlib.h, math.h and string.h. The version of MatLab we used is the one from 2025. 

### Build

We used gcc to compile our C code on VS Code. 

### Execute

Describe how the program should be executed. Ideally, it will be automated to one line of code in a terminal running Bash (e.g., `matlab -batch src/myscript`), with the outputs generated to "results/".
